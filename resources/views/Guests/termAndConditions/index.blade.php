            <h3> General Terms of Service</h3>
            <p>
                In order for Vendors to upload and/or publish a profile and/or other information on the Website
                (the “Subscription”), Vendors must timely and fully pay a subscription fee (the “Subscription
                Fee”) to the Company, as determined by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion. The
                Subscription Fee shall be paid on a monthly basis on or before the first day of each month. In the
                event the Subscription Fee is not timely and fully paid, Company reserves the right to charge a late
                fee, in its sole and absolute discretion, and/or delete such non-compliant Vendor’s profile and other
                information from the Website, without any notice to the Vendor. In addition, the Company may
                conduct background checks of Vendors and, based on the results of such background checks, the
                Company reserves the right to terminate the Subscription and delete a Vendor’s profile and other
                information from the Website at any time, in its sole and absolute discretion. Any violation of
                these Terms and Conditions and/or any other policy of the Company shall result in the termination
                of the Subscription and removal of a Vendor’s profile and information from the Website at any
                time, in the Company’s sole and absolute discretion and without notice of any kind to such Vendor.
                Vendors hereby acknowledge and agree that the services requested from the Company have been
                specially curated for the Vendor’s specific needs and, therefore, the Subscription Fee may not be
                returned, refunded, and/or credited. The Subscription shall automatically renew on a monthly basis
                unless otherwise terminated by either the Vendor or Company by providing the other with ten (10)
                days’ prior written notice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Vendors further acknowledge and agree that the Company may terminate the Subscription and
                delete and remove Vendor profiles and information at any time in its sole and absolute discretion
                and without notice of any kind to such Vendor. In the event of the termination of the Subscription,
                removal of a Vendor’s profile or information from the Website, and/or scheduled or unscheduled
                downtime, maintenance, system updates, malfunction, or other unavailability of any portion or all
                of the Website, Company or Vendor product, or service for any reason, including as a result of
                power outages, system failures, or other interruptions, then the Company shall not be obligated to
                refund or credit the Subscription Fee or Service Fee (as defined below).</p>
            <p>
                Customers of the Vendors’ services shall pay a service fee (the “Service Fee”) for such Vendors’
                services as determined by the Vendor. The Service Fee must be paid through the Website. The
                Company is not obligated or responsible for any returns, refunds, or credits of the Service Fee. If
                a customer of a Vendor’s services is dissatisfied with the Vendor’s services, the customer must
                reach out to and/or file a complaint directly with the Vendor, and not the Company. Vendors shall
                receive the Service Fee or a portion of the Service Fee to their Stripe accounts through the Website.
                Company may issue a discount on the Subscription Fee or Service Fee at any time, in its sole and
                absolute discretion. Such discount is not guaranteed and may be revoked by the Company at any
                time.</p>
            <p>
                By requesting products and/or services from the Company, you are (i) offering to purchase a
                product and/or service from Company, (ii) representing that you are at least 18 years old or

                receiving the product and/or service, and you may not receive the product or service until we verify

                at any time without notice to you (including after you have submitted your request for products
                and/or services) and without being liable to you. We reserve the right to limit, reject, modify, or
                cancel requests for products and/or services that, in our sole judgment, appear to be placed by

                We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to limit products or services to any person, geographic

                provision of these Terms and Conditions is found to be invalid by any court having competent
                jurisdiction, the invalidity of all or part of a provision shall not affect the validity of the
