            <h3>Personal Information</h3>
            <p>Personal Information is any information that may, directly or indirectly, identify, relate to, or
                describe you through particular reference to a unique identifier, including name, postal address,
                email address, telephone number, location data, online identifier, or to one or more factors that are
                specific to your physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity.
                Personal Information also includes inferences drawn from any of the information collected to
                create a profile about you reflecting your preferences, characteristics, psychological trends,
                predispositions, behavior, attitudes, intelligence, abilities, and aptitudes. </p>
            <p>In order to operate the Website in an efficient and effective manner, we may collect Personal
                Information, including, but not limited to, name, email address, mailing address, phone number,
                geographic location, and other information that may, directly or indirectly, reveal your personal
                identity and which you may provide to Company during your use of the Website. The Company
                may also conduct background checks of Vendors (as defined in the Company’s Terms and

            <p>If you make any payments on or through this Website, your payment information (e.g., credit or
                debit card type, number, and expiration date) and related information (e.g., billing address) may
                be collected by us and/or our third-party payment processors. </p>
            <p>If you connect to the Website using Facebook, Instagram, Google, or another social networking
                site (each a “Social Networking Site”), we may receive information that you authorize the Social
                Networking Site to share with us, which may include public profile information, birthday, current
                city, work, school, and email address. This information constitutes Personal Information and is
                therefore subject to this Policy. Any information that we collect from your Social Networking Site
                account may depend on the privacy settings you have set with the Social Networking Site, so

                disconnect your Social Networking Site account from your Company account by adapting the
                privacy settings in your Social Networking Site account. If you come to the Website through a

            <h3>Data Security </h3>
            <p>The Company employs commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security and privacy of the
                data and information the Company collects online and maintains on its database(s) hosted on
                thirdparty servers. Unfortunately, however, no security system can be guaranteed to be 100%
                effective
                as the Internet is not a completely secure medium. Therefore, although the Company is committed
                to protecting your privacy, the Company cannot and does not guarantee, and you should not expect,
                that your Personal Information, private communications, or other user content will always remain
                private. To protect your privacy, please do not use the Website to communicate information that
                you want kept confidential. The Company will not be responsible for any damages you or others
                may suffer as a result of the loss of confidentiality of any such information. </p>
            <p>The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or
                where you have chosen) a username and password for access to certain parts of our Website, you
                are responsible for keeping this username and password confidential. We ask you not to share your

                your use of the Website, third-party materials, the Internet generally, and the documents and/or
